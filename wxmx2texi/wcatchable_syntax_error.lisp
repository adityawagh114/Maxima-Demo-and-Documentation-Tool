;; Punt to Maxima function 'error' so that syntax errors can be caught by 'errcatch'.
;; This definition replaces the built-in MREAD-SYNERR
;; which throws to the top level of the interpreter in a way which cannot
;; be intercepted by 'errcatch'.
;;
;; After a syntax error is detected, the global variable 'error'
;; contains the error message (which is also printed on the console
;; when the error occurs).
;;
;; Aside from punting to 'error', this implementation doesn't try to
;; do anything else which the built-in MREAD-SYNERR does. In particular
;; this implementation doesn't try to output any input-line information.
