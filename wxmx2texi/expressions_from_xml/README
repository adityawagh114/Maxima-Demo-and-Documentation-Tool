Code in this folder extracts a list of tokens from wxmx <output> XML tags
and calls the Maxima parser to reconstitute the Maxima expression
represented by the tokens.

An example (using the output-examples.xml file in the repo) can be executed by:

$ maxima --lisp clisp --batch display_output_xml.mac

So far I tried Clisp and SBCL. Clisp worked, while SBCL did not.
The problem seems to be that .lisp files are not read as Unicode
characters. Yes, there is a :external-format flag for LOAD,
but no, I couldn't get it to work. I'll keep trying.

Other Unicode-aware Lisps might work, I didn't try any.
